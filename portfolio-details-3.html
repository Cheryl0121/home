            <h2>‘Mom, can I try marijuana?’ What did this Chinese American mother answer?</h2>
            <span><b>by Han Cui</b></span>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
             “Is marijuana addictive?” Josephina asks. “It is. But at the scale of addictiveness, it isn’t the worst. If you like the feeling, you will come back and seek more and eventually, some people may not be able to quit.” Yinghua explains.
         </p>
         <p>Growing up in Maryland, 14-year-old Josephina is unfamiliar with marijuana despite having heard about it from her teachers, friends, and the media. With all the different opinions about marijuana, she is getting curious and confused.
         </p>
            <p>Yinghua, Josephina’s mother, arrived in the United States from China about twenty years ago, pursued her higher education, and finally attained a Ph.D. in Chemistry. She has rich working experiences in pharmacy, hospital work, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yinghua has three daughters; two of them have attended college, and Josephina, the youngest, is in middle school. </p>
            <p>She thinks it is time to have a conversation with Josephina about marijuana. When asked by her mother whether she would try marijuana when she reaches the minimum age, Josephina answers, “Yes, I would, just to know how it feels.” The answer caught Yinghua off guard but to ease her mother, Josephina added, “I wouldn’t want to keep on using it. It would be a one-time thing.”  </p>
            <p>“What if you really like it after trying?” Yinghua continues dramatically. “That would be a big problem. I think I would probably get help,” Josephina says, laughing aloud. </p>
            <p>Since 2014, marijuana has been legal in Maryland for the medical purposes of patients and caregivers who are registered with the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC). Although cannabis for adult or recreational use remains illegal, the push and support for legalization has increased. </p>
            <p>The legalization of marijuana for either medical or recreational has proven to be an irreversible trend not only in Maryland but also in other states in the US. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the medical use of cannabis has been legalized in 36 states, the District of Columbia, and four US territories. Recreational use, on the other hand, has been legalized in 15 states, the District of Columbia, and two US territories. The Commercial distribution of it is permitted in all jurisdictions where cannabis is legal, except the District of Columbia. </p>
            <p>Statistics depict that Asian Americans have lower rates of substance abuse in general than other major racial groups in the US, with the Chinese American community having the lowest rate of marijuana use. Attitudes towards marijuana differ among different generations. The first-generation Chinese American has a lower acceptance of marijuana than the next generations. </p>
            <p>“Chinese American parents hold polarized views on marijuana. Most of them strongly oppose it and view it as a gateway drug. They think using marijuana is like knocking on forbidden doors and never mention it to their children,” Says Yinghua. </p>
            <p>In Maryland, hundreds of Chinese American parents joined groups on WeChat - a popular social media platform among Chinese communities, to express their resentments on the state’s marijuana legislation. They signed petitions and organized protests to stop marijuana legalization. </p>
            <p>“I understand their concerns. The first-generation parents growing up in China are usually very conservative to marijuana because of their culture and backgrounds. They will not allow a single marijuana store to open nearby since they think it will lead their kids astray. But in my opinion, marijuana is not a taboo,” Yinghua says. </p>
            <p>With the legalization of marijuana, teenagers now have more access to obtain it. According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, teens could more easily access marijuana than beer and prescription drugs. In their study, 40% of teens could get marijuana within a day, 25% said they could get it within an hour. Moreover, many products containing marijuana, such as baked goods, candies, and beverages, are popular among teenagers. Therefore, no matter how strongly Chinese American parents oppose marijuana, they must face the reality that marijuana has become an issue among teenagers. </p>
            <p>As stated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), marijuana use may impale the developing teen’s brain causing memory problems, learning, and coordination difficulties, thus ruin a teenager’s future.
Yinghua shared an example that happened in their surroundings with Josephina. “A high school classmate of your sister was expelled from school last week because she brought in weed brownies and shared them with some friends. One person got so sick that she threw up and was taken to the hospital.” </p>
            <p>Obviously, this teenager did not know that bringing or using marijuana in school violated the school’s law. Supposedly, the lack of proper parental supervision was one of the causes of this tragedy. </p>
            <p>Dr. Xiaoyan Zhang, a visiting professor at the School of Social Work at the University of Pittsburgh who served on the National Advisory Council for NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) between 2007 and 2010, explained why teenagers are more likely to get addicted to marijuana than adults, and why parental supervision is needed. </p>
            <p>“In adolescence, people’s forebrain associated with maturity is still developing. The lack of complete development of teenagers’ brains may cause risky and impulsive behaviors and actions. So, it’s harder for them to resist the temptation of abusing drugs. The later a child is exposed to drugs, the less chance he would get addicted. Therefore, parents are their children’s first protection against drugs. Early education on marijuana education is crucial for protecting children from drug abuse.” </p>
            <p>Although many Chinese American parents score high in paying attention to their children’s academic and career performances, marijuana education is usually neglected. Unlike these parents, Yinghua thinks having open dialogues with her daughter would be a better way to provide parenting in marijuana. </p>
            <p>“Sit down and have an open dialogue with my daughter like a friend,” Yinghua said. She wants to pass along the knowledge that she has as a pharmacologist to Josephina through conversations. “I’ve explained the benefits and side effects of marijuana to her and let her make decision when she goes to the college. I hope that she will make a right choice.” </p>
            <p>Despite many engaging in its use, marijuana continues to remain harmful to teenagers’ health. Many parents are at war with the use of marijuana by their children, worried about their effects and how it has a significant impact on their futures. The battle is still on, and hopefully, the ‘puzzle’ that Chinese American parents have will be solved in due time. </p>
